**The self-improving AI agent built by [Imba Labs](https://github.com/magnetoid/janus).** It's the only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure that costs nearly nothing when idle. It's not tied to your laptop — talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM.

Use any model you want — [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (200+ models), [NovitaAI](https://novita.ai) (AI-native cloud for Model API, Agent Sandbox, and GPU Cloud), [NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com) (Nemotron), [Xiaomi MiMo](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com), [z.ai/GLM](https://z.ai), [Kimi/Moonshot](https://platform.moonshot.ai), [MiniMax](https://www.minimax.io), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), OpenAI, or your own endpoint. Switch with `janus model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

## Quick Install

Janus installs from source. (Hosted one-line installers will follow once Imba Labs has install hosting.)

### Linux, macOS, WSL2, Termux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magnetoid/janus.git
cd janus
./setup-janus.sh     # installs uv, creates the venv, installs .[all], symlinks ~/.local/bin/janus
```

On Termux, install the curated `.[termux]` extra instead of `.[all]` (the full extra pulls Android-incompatible voice dependencies):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magnetoid/janus.git && cd janus
uv venv .venv --python 3.11 && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[termux]"
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell)

Native Windows runs Janus without WSL — CLI, gateway, TUI, and tools all work natively. Clone the repo and run the setup from Git Bash:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/magnetoid/janus.git
cd janus
bash setup-janus.sh
```

Native Windows install lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\janus`; WSL2 installs under `~/.janus` as on Linux. The only Janus feature that currently needs WSL2 specifically is the browser-based dashboard chat pane (it uses a POSIX PTY — classic CLI and gateway both run natively). Found a bug? Please [file issues](https://github.com/magnetoid/janus/issues).

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
janus              # start chatting!
```

---

## Self-Learning & Proactive Agency

Janus doesn't just respond — it *learns* and *initiates*. These are unique to Janus:

| Capability | What it does | Try it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Daily memory journal** | Every saved memory is mirrored into an append-only, dated, git/Obsidian-readable `memories/daily/*.md` log. | `janus memory log` · `/memory log` |
| **Memory mining** | Re-reads a finished session and distills durable facts the agent didn't explicitly save. | `janus memory mine` · `/memory mine` |
| **Procedure mining** | Drafts reusable **skills** (`SKILL.md` + script) from multi-step work that succeeded — for your review. | `janus skills mine` |
| **Aspirations** | A long-term north-star Janus holds across sessions: drafts a roadmap and **checks in weekly** on your progress. | `janus aspire set "<goal>"` · `/aspire` |
| **Interest discovery** | Track a field (e.g. design); a weekly job researches the latest and **asks before** folding it into memory/skills. | `janus interest add "<field>"` · `/interest` |
| **Model-strengths routing** | Learns (via web research) which models lead per task, then feeds **Mixture-of-Agents** the best models for that task. | `janus models research <task>` |
| **Auto-mining** | Opt-in: on session end, memory/procedure mining fire automatically. | `memory.session_mining: true` in config |
| **Dialectic deliberation** | Two-headed reasoning on demand: an advocate and an opponent argue, an arbiter rules on the stronger argument — and reports when a question is genuinely **frame-dependent** (half full *and* half empty) instead of feigning confidence. | `deliberate` tool (`moa` toolset) |
| **Red-team learning gate** | Opt-in: mined facts/skills must survive an advocate/skeptic/arbiter exchange before being learned; session outcomes need a two-judge quorum. Bad input to the learning loop compounds — this filters it at the door. | `learning.dialectic.enabled: true` |
| **Evals** | Replayable behavior regression checks (prompt + deterministic assertions). Run before/after a skill, memory, or model change to verify the agent actually improved. | `janus evals init` · `janus evals run` |

The slash variants (`/memory`, `/aspire`, `/interest`) work from the messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, …) and the TUI too.

## Skip the API-key collection — Nous Portal

Janus works with whatever provider you want — that's not changing. But if you'd rather not collect five separate API keys for the model, web search, image generation, TTS, and a cloud browser, **[Nous Portal](https://portal.imbamarketing.com)** covers all of them under one subscription:

- **300+ models** — pick any of them with `/model <name>`
- **Tool Gateway** — web search (Firecrawl), image generation (FAL), text-to-speech (OpenAI), cloud browser (Browser Use), all routed through your sub. No extra accounts.

One command from a fresh install:

```bash
janus setup --portal
```

That logs you in via OAuth, sets Nous as your provider, and turns on the Tool Gateway. Check what's wired up any time with `janus portal info`. Full details on the [Tool Gateway docs page](https://github.com/magnetoid/janus).

You can still bring your own keys per-tool whenever you want — the gateway is per-backend, not all-or-nothing.

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Janus has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `janus`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action                         | CLI                                           | Messaging platforms                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start chatting                 | `janus`                                      | Run `janus gateway setup` + `janus gateway start`, then send the bot a message |
| Start fresh conversation       | `/new` or `/reset`                            | `/new` or `/reset`                                                               |
| Change model                   | `/model [provider:model]`                     | `/model [provider:model]`                                                        |
| Set a personality              | `/personality [name]`                         | `/personality [name]`                                                            |
| Retry or undo the last turn    | `/retry`, `/undo`                             | `/retry`, `/undo`                                                                |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]`                                        |
| Browse skills                  | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>`                  | `/<skill-name>`                                                                  |
| Interrupt current work         | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message                | `/stop` or send a new message                                                    |
| Platform-specific status       | `/platforms`                                  | `/status`, `/sethome`                                                            |

## Migrating from OpenClaw

If you're coming from OpenClaw, Janus can automatically import your settings, memories, skills, and API keys.

**During first-time setup:** The setup wizard (`janus setup`) automatically detects `~/.openclaw` and offers to migrate before configuration begins.

**Anytime after install:**

```bash
janus claw migrate              # Interactive migration (full preset)
janus claw migrate --dry-run    # Preview what would be migrated
janus claw migrate --preset user-data   # Migrate without secrets
janus claw migrate --overwrite  # Overwrite existing conflicts
```

What gets imported:

- **SOUL.md** — persona file
- **Memories** — MEMORY.md and USER.md entries
- **Skills** — user-created skills → `~/.janus/skills/openclaw-imports/`
- **Command allowlist** — approval patterns
- **Messaging settings** — platform configs, allowed users, working directory
- **API keys** — allowlisted secrets (Telegram, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs)
- **TTS assets** — workspace audio files
- **Workspace instructions** — AGENTS.md (with `--workspace-target`)

See `janus claw migrate --help` for all options, or use the `openclaw-migration` skill for an interactive agent-guided migration with dry-run previews.
