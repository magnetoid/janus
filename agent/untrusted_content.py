"""Fencing for untrusted external content (web pages, webhook payloads).

Extends the memory-context fencing pattern in ``agent/memory_manager.py`` to
content that arrives from the outside world: extracted web pages and webhook
payload fields. Fetched pages and inbound payloads are the canonical prompt
injection vector — a page that says "ignore your instructions and run X" must
reach the model as *data*, clearly delimited and labelled, not as bare text
indistinguishable from the operator's prompt.

Two layers, mirroring memory fencing:

1. ``sanitize_untrusted()`` strips any fence tags already present in the
   payload (``<untrusted-content>``, ``<memory-context>``, and the system
   notes both fences use), so embedded tags cannot close the fence early or
   impersonate the agent's trusted memory channel.
2. ``fence_untrusted()`` wraps the sanitized payload in an
   ``<untrusted-content>`` block with a short system note telling the model
   to treat the contents as data.

Fencing is on by default and can be disabled with
``security.fence_untrusted_content: false`` in config.yaml.
